## Environments

This repository by default supports three environments: `local`, `development`,
and `testing`. Each environment is represented by an appropriate environment file:

| Environment | File | URL                                  |
| --- | --- |--------------------------------------|
| local | .env | [http://localhost](http://localhost) |
| testing | .env.testing | -                                    |
| development | .env.development | [:api_link](:api_link)               |
